# Systems Programming MMY502

This are some of my lab homework that I had to complete during the systems programming class at 2017.

A lot of refactoring has been done to reflect my current expertise on the C programming language.

Some labs are missing due to lost homework assignment requirements that where given.
If I ever find them in my possession again, I will re-implement them and update this course module.
